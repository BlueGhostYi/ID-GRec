# ID-GRec
**ID-based Graph Recommendation Framework (PyTorch)**

ID-GRec is a **graph recommendation framework** based on Python and Pytorch, which contains the current mainstream and latest graph recommendation methods, the most classic datasets, evaluation metrics and testing processes. One of the advantages of ID-GRec is that it is easy to get started, with a simple configuration of the model parameters, and the training can be executed in a simple one-step commands without any other operations. 

ID-GRec is dedicated to exploring the latest research results on graph-based recommender systems and comparing them in a unified framework. Therefore, we adopt LightGCN, a classic work on graph recommender systems, as a benchmark in ID-GRec and refer to a large number of related works and frameworks. Further, we roughly categorize the existing methods into *graph neural network-based methods (GNN)* and *graph self-supervised learning-based methods (SSL)*. And they are compared under a unified framework, which includes publications in various flagship conferences and journals in recent years. In addition, we also simply implement BPRMF as a most basic comparison baseline as well as an extensible template.

## Environment (based on our test platform)
```
python == 3.8.18
pytorch == 2.1.0 (cuda:12.1)
scipy == 1.10.1
numpy == 1.24.3
tdqm == 4.65.0
```
> For some special models, additional third-party libraries may be required.

## Examples to Run 
Steps to run the code (MODEL_NAME is the name of the model):
1. In the folder . /configure to configure the MODEL_NAME.txt file;
2. Run main.py `python main.py` and select the identifier of MODEL_NAME or specify through the command line:`python main.py --model=MODEL_NAME`

Example:
If you want to run LightGCN:
1. In the folder . /configure to configure the LightGCN.txt file;
2. Run main.py `python main.py` and select the identifier of LightGCN or specify through the command line:`python main.py --model=LightGCN`

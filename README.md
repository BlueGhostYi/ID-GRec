# ID-GRec
**ID-based Graph Recommendation Framework (PyTorch)**
<p float="left"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-v3.8.18-blue"> <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PyTorch-v2.1.0-green"> <br>

ID-GRec is a **graph recommendation framework** based on Python and Pytorch, which contains the current mainstream and latest graph recommendation methods, the most classic datasets, evaluation metrics and testing processes. One of the advantages of ID-GRec is that it is easy to get started, with a simple configuration of the model parameters, and the training can be executed in a simple one-step commands without any other operations. 

ID-GRec is dedicated to exploring the latest research results on graph-based recommender systems and comparing them in a unified framework. Therefore, we adopt LightGCN, a classic work on graph recommender systems, as a benchmark in ID-GRec and refer to a large number of related works and frameworks. Further, we roughly categorize the existing methods into *graph neural network-based methods (GNN)* and *graph self-supervised learning-based methods (SSL)*. And they are compared under a unified framework, which includes publications in various flagship conferences and journals in recent years. In addition, we also simply implement BPRMF as a most basic comparison baseline as well as an extensible template.

## Environment (based on our test platform)
```
python == 3.8.18
pytorch == 2.1.0 (cuda:12.1)
scipy == 1.10.1
numpy == 1.24.3
tdqm == 4.65.0
```
> For some special models, additional third-party libraries may be required.

## Examples to Run 
Steps to run the code (MODEL_NAME is the name of the model):
1. In the folder . /configure to configure the MODEL_NAME.txt file;
2. Run main.py `python main.py` and select the identifier of MODEL_NAME or specify through the command line:`python main.py --model=MODEL_NAME`

Example:
If you want to run LightGCN:
1. In the folder . /configure to configure the LightGCN.txt file;
2. Run main.py `python main.py` and select the identifier of LightGCN or specify through the command line:`python main.py --model=LightGCN`

## Configuration File Description
The folder named “configure” contains the hyperparameters, datasets, and other miscellaneous settings for all implemented methods. Except for model-specific hyperparameters, the settings listed at the top are common to all models. Using LightGCN.txt as an example, the following provides an introduction to the common settings:
1. `dataset_path` = ./dataset/`: Specifies the file path to the folder containing the dataset files.
2. `dataset = yelp2018`: Sets the name of the dataset to be used, in this case, "yelp2018."
3. `top_K = [5, 10, 20]`: Defines the list of top-K values for evaluation metrics, meaning the model will evaluate its performance using the top 5, top 10, and top 20 predictions.
4. `training_epochs = 1000`: Specifies the number of training epochs, or iterations over the entire dataset, set to 1000.
5. `early_stopping = 10`: Sets the early stopping criterion; training will halt if there's no improvement in performance for 10 consecutive tests.
6. `embedding_size = 64`: Defines the size of the embeddings (or the dimensionality of the embedding vectors) for the model, set to 64.
7. `batch_size = 2048`: Sets the number of samples in each batch for training, with 2048 samples per batch.
8. `test_batch_size = 200`: Specifies the number of samples in each batch for testing, set to 200.
9. `learn_rate = 0.001`: Sets the learning rate, which controls the step size during optimization, to 0.001.
10. `reg_lambda = 0.0001`: Specifies the regularization parameter (often for weight decay), which helps prevent overfitting, set to 0.0001.
11. `GCN_layer = 3`: Defines the number of graph convolutional network (GCN) layers in the model, set to 3.
12. `sparsity_test = 0`: Indicates whether a sparsity test is performed. Setting this to 0 generally means the sparsity test is disabled. If you want to perform a sparsity test, please set it to 1.
